        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Born in 2005 in Colombia, Honda-Tolima. <br> I am convinced that web design can be more <br> inclusive and exciting. My purpose is to discover <br> how to unite technology and design to create digital <br> experiences that are not only attractive, but also <br> functional and accessible to all users. In my free <br> time I really like to play video games and listen to <br> music. I think that music has the power to connect <br> emotions and tell stories without the need for words, <br> which inspires me in  my creative process. I also enjoy <br> exploring new tools and learning techniques that will <br> help me improve my programming  and design skills. <br> My goal is to continue growing in the world of <br> technology, always looking for ways to innovate <br> and make digital design more inclusive for everyone. <br> I am currently 19 years old and I am studying information systems technology at the Antonio Jos√© Camacho University.
